# Professional README Generator

- I have created a README generator, for the sake of being able to have this README file and another generated file, i have created a folder called generated and a file which is created in here called generatedREADME

- A question array is used which takes in input from the terminal when you run the index.js file using 'node index.js'.

- This application is designed to help developers create effective and professional README file for their GitHub repositories. This application is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file from user input using the Inquirer npm package.
